## Future Tasks

- [ ] New route for updateCode that only sends the latest generated code + the modify request
- [ ] Make it generate more consistent apps by only importing from a component library like shadcn
- [ ] Try to resolve the npm libraries issue, look into how Claude Artifacts and others deal with it
- [ ] Fix bug where if a user edits the code, then does a change, it doesn't use the edited code
- [ ] Save previous versions so people can go back and forth between the generated ones
- [ ] Apply code diffs directly instead of asking the model to generate the code from scratch'
- [ ] Add the ability to upload things like a screenshot to it for it to start from that
- [ ] Support different kinds of apps (not just React) & scripts with Python for example
